Here we go! At first, I want to tell you some basic facts about me:

```yaml
name: "Ferdinand Berger"
nickname: "Ferdy"
born: 1985
wife:
  - name: "Sonja"
children:
  - name: "Hanna"
    born: 2016
  - name: "Robin"
    born: 2020
home: "South-West of Germany"
```

Recently I found out, that I have ADHD that was not detected in my childhood. I did live with it for over 30 years without any issues, but it does explain a lot of things for me.
## Daily work
In my day-to-day job, I am a tech lead for a small team of IT-Administrators. We take care of the OT-server infrastructure worldwide for our company. This includes the deployment and maintenance of servers but also making sure, that certain applications and services are always available.
## Free time?
In my free time, I do voluntary work for the Red Cross in Germany, play with my children, trying to learn how to ride a Longboard, tinker around with my 3D printer and a lot of other tech/it-related stuff.
