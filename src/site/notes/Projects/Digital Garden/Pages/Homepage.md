This is a first test of a digital-garden based on my Obsidian vault.

To create this Digital Garden, I use - as mentioned above - Obsidian for writing this content and a plugin called [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) for publishing. More details about my process on creating notes and my decision on what I want to publish and why can be found on this sub-page: [[Projects/Digital Garden/Pages/Why and How I build this page\|Why and How I build this page]]
