# Welcome!

This is my first test of a digital-garden based on my Obsidian vault.

To create this Digital Garden, I use - as mentioned above - Obsidian for writing this content and a plugin called [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) for publishing. More details about my process on creating notes and my decision on what I want to publish and why can be found on this sub-page: [[Projects/Digital Garden/Pages/Why and How I build this page\|Why and How I build this page]]
## What you can find here
Notes seasoned with typos, strange formulations and a messy structure. I publish the notes in the language I wrote them - so they are in German or English. Some of the links here lead to blank pages. This may be because the note does not yet exist, or because I have not published the note. 

## Who is writing those notes?
This is a great question you have. If you want to find out more about me, take a look [[Projects/Digital Garden/Pages/About me\|here]].
